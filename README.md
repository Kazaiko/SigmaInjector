## About SigmaInjector
SigmaInjector is a LoadLibrary-based injector designed for QHide Skeet. It allocates memory in csgo.exe at a specific address required for Skeet Cr4ck to function correctly.

- **VAC support:** No need for `-insecure`.
- **Compilation:** Compile in **Release x86**.
- **Admin rights:** Run the injector with administrator privileges.
- **Dependency:** `skeet.dll` must be in the same folder as the injector.
